                    <p>
                        In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI) agents, designing the agent's characteristics is crucial for shaping user experience. This workshop aims to establish a research community focused on AI agent persona design for various contexts, such as in-car assistants, educational tools, and smart home environments. We will explore critical aspects of persona design, such as voice, embodiment, and demographics, and their impact on user satisfaction and engagement. Through discussions and hands-on activities, we aim to propose practices and standards that enhance the ecological validity of agent personas. Topics include the design of conversational interfaces, the influence of agent personas on user experience, and approaches for creating contextually appropriate AI agents. This workshop will provide a platform for building a community dedicated to developing AI agent personas that better fit diverse, everyday interactions.
