                    <p id="about" style="text-align: justify;">
                        In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI) agents, designing the agent's characteristics is crucial for shaping user experience. This workshop aims to establish a research community focused on AI agent persona design for various contexts, such as in-car assistants, educational tools, and smart home environments. We will explore critical aspects of persona design, such as voice, embodiment, and demographics, and their impact on user satisfaction and engagement. Through discussions and hands-on activities, we aim to propose practices and standards that enhance the ecological validity of agent personas. Topics include the design of conversational interfaces, the influence of agent personas on user experience, and approaches for creating contextually appropriate AI agents. This workshop will provide a platform for building a community dedicated to developing AI agent personas that better fit diverse, everyday interactions.

                        Join us for a full-day in-person workshop to advance the discourse on Enhancing Human-Agent Interaction Through Thoughtful Persona Design at MUM 2024 in Stockholm.
                        <br><br>
                        <b>How should AI agents look? How should they communicate? How should they interact with people? Ultimately, how should their experiential side be designed?</b><br>
                        These are key questions in the fast-evolving field of AI agents, where the design and representation of agent personas play a vital role in shaping user interactions and experiences. We aim to bring together experts from diverse disciplines to explore and discuss the design of conversational AI agent personas across various contexts, such as in-car assistants, educational support tools, or smart home environments.
                        <br><br>
                        We encourage the submission of position papers (2-4 pages in <a href="https://chi2024.acm.org/submission-guides/chi-publication-formats/">ACM single-column format</a>, including references) that present research findings, innovative ideas, and work-in-progress related to AI agent persona design. We also welcome expressions of interest from those who may not have formal papers but wish to contribute to the workshop.
